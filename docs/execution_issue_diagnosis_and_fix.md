# üîß Execution Issue Diagnosis and Fix - GoEmotions DeBERTa Advanced Loss Functions

## üéØ Root Cause Analysis

**Issue Identified**: Distributed training path resolution failure  
**Error Pattern**: `[Errno 2] No such file or directory` across all 5 configurations  
**Exit Code**: 2 (file not found) from accelerate distributed launcher

### Detailed Error Analysis
```bash
# Error pattern observed:
E0903 14:17:36.992000 ... torch/distributed/elastic/multiprocessing/api.py:826] 
failed (exitcode: 2) local_rank: 0 (pid: 311668) of binary: /venv/main/bin/python

# Root cause: accelerate launch cannot find the script file
# Command being executed:
accelerate launch --num_processes=2 --mixed_precision=fp16 python3 scripts/train_deberta_local.py
```

**Technical Root Cause**: The distributed training launcher cannot resolve the relative path `scripts/train_deberta_local.py` when spawning worker processes. Each distributed worker process needs to locate the script file, but the working directory context is lost during process spawning.

## üîß Solution Implementation

### Fix Strategy
1. **Use absolute paths** for script execution in distributed training
2. **Add working directory validation** to ensure correct execution context
3. **Implement fallback to single-GPU** when distributed training fails
4. **Add path resolution debugging** for better error diagnosis

### Code Fix for rigorous_loss_comparison.py

```python
# Line 76-90: Fix script path resolution
def run_single_experiment(self, config_name, config, num_epochs=1, single_gpu=False):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Fix: Use absolute path for the training script
    script_path = os.path.abspath("scripts/train_deberta_local.py")
    if not os.path.exists(script_path):
        # Fallback: try relative path from current directory
        script_path = "scripts/train_deberta_local.py"
        if not os.path.exists(script_path):
            return {"success": False, "error": f"Training script not found: {script_path}"}
    
    # Build command with absolute path
    cmd = [
        "python3", script_path,  # Use resolved absolute path
        "--output_dir", str(output_dir),
        # ... rest of arguments
    ]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Fix Implementation

### Option 1: Path Resolution Fix (Recommended)
```python
# Modified rigorous_loss_comparison.py with absolute path resolution
import os
from pathlib import Path

class RigorousLossComparison:
    def __init__(self, base_output_dir="./rigorous_experiments"):
        # ... existing code ...
        # Ensure we're in the correct working directory
        self.project_root = Path.cwd()
        self.script_path = self.project_root / "scripts" / "train_deberta_local.py"
        
        if not self.script_path.exists():
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"Training script not found: {self.script_path}")
    
    def run_single_experiment(self, config_name, config, num_epochs=1, single_gpu=False):
        # ... existing code ...
        
        # Build command with absolute path
        cmd = [
            "python3", str(self.script_path),  # Absolute path
            "--output_dir", str(output_dir),
            # ... other arguments
        ]
```

### Option 2: Working Directory Fix
```python
# Alternative: Ensure correct working directory
def run_single_experiment(self, config_name, config, num_epochs=1, single_gpu=False):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Change to project root before executing
    original_cwd = os.getcwd()
    project_root = "/home/user/goemotions-deberta"
    
    try:
        os.chdir(project_root)
        
        # Now relative path should work
        cmd = ["python3", "scripts/train_deberta_local.py", ...]
        
        # Execute command
        result = subprocess.run(cmd, ...)
        
    finally:
        os.chdir(original_cwd)  # Restore original directory
```

### Option 3: Single-GPU Fallback (Quick Test)
```bash
# Test single-GPU execution first to validate script functionality
cd /home/user/goemotions-deberta
python3 scripts/train_deberta_local.py \
  --output_dir ./test_output \
  --num_train_epochs 1 \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 8
```

## üìã Step-by-Step Fix Implementation

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Verify working directory**:
```bash
cd /home/user/goemotions-deberta
pwd  # Should show: /home/user/goemotions-deberta
ls scripts/train_deberta_local.py  # Should exist
```

2. **Test single-GPU execution**:
```bash
# Test basic functionality without distributed training
python3 scripts/train_deberta_local.py --help
```

3. **Fix rigorous_loss_comparison.py path resolution**:
   - Use absolute paths for script execution
   - Add path validation before execution
   - Ensure working directory is correct

4. **Test fixed implementation**:
```bash
# After applying fix
python3 scripts/rigorous_loss_comparison.py
```

## üîç Validation Steps

### Pre-Fix Validation Checklist:
- [ ] Verify current working directory: `/home/user/goemotions-deberta`
- [ ] Confirm script exists: `scripts/train_deberta_local.py`
- [ ] Test basic script execution: `python3 scripts/train_deberta_local.py --help`
- [ ] Verify data cache exists: `ls data/goemotions/`
- [ ] Check model cache: `ls models/deberta-v3-large/`

### Post-Fix Validation:
- [ ] Single configuration test passes
- [ ] Distributed training launches successfully  
- [ ] At least one experiment completes without path errors
- [ ] Output directories are created correctly

## üéØ Expected Outcome After Fix

**Success Criteria**:
- All 5 configurations launch without "file not found" errors
- Training processes start and can load data/models
- Proper error handling for any subsequent training issues
- Distributed training workers can locate and execute the script

**Performance Impact**: No impact on training performance, only fixes the execution path resolution issue.

## üö® Next Steps After Path Fix

1. **Re-run rigorous comparison** with fixed path resolution
2. **Monitor for new error types** (data loading, model loading, CUDA issues)
3. **Validate single-GPU fallback** works as designed
4. **Proceed with performance validation** once execution succeeds

## üí° Lessons Learned

**Key Insight**: Distributed training with accelerate requires absolute paths or careful working directory management. Relative paths can break when processes are spawned across multiple GPUs.

**Best Practice**: Always use absolute paths for distributed training scripts or ensure working directory is properly managed in subprocess calls.

This fix addresses the immediate execution blocking issue and should restore the project to its intended 95% completion state, ready for the performance validation phase.
