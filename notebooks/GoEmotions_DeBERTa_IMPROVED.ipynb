    "- **HPO**: Optuna for hyperparameter optimization (LR, batch_size, gamma, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Aug**: SMOTE for imbalance, nlpaug for text augmentation (augment_prob)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loss Enhancements**: Focal loss variants (gamma), per-class weights, threshold sweeps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Architecture Mods**: Freeze layers option, increased dropout, label smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensembles**: Soft-voting across top models\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Early stopping, logging with tensorboard\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimization**: DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 for memory efficiency\n",
