    "## Implementing All Improvements: HPO, Data Aug, Arch Mods, Ensembles, Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOAL**: Achieve >60% F1 macro at threshold=0.2 with comprehensive enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "**KEY IMPROVEMENTS APPLIED**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HPO**: Optuna for hyperparameter optimization (LR, batch_size, gamma, etc.)\n",
    "- **Data Aug**: SMOTE for imbalance, nlpaug for text augmentation (augment_prob)\n",
    "- **Loss Enhancements**: Focal loss variants (gamma), per-class weights, threshold sweeps\n",
    "- **Architecture Mods**: Freeze layers option, increased dropout, label smoothing\n",
    "- **Ensembles**: Soft-voting across top models\n",
    "- **Monitoring**: Early stopping, logging with tensorboard\n",
    "- **Optimization**: DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 for memory efficiency\n",
    "- **Script Updates**: Added args to train_deberta_local.py (gamma, augment_prob, freeze_layers, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow**: Environment → Script Edits → Data Prep/Aug → HPO → Training with Monitoring → Ensembles → Eval\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected**: 60-70% F1 macro, 2x faster with ZeRO-2, robust to imbalance"
